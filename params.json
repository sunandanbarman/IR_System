We named our product accordingly as “Social curry”. Social Curry is an interactive search system which presents multi-lingual results from twitter based on user query, along with interesting charts and graphs pertinent to the query result set.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nThe primary source of the data consists of more than 10000 tweets collected from twitter over a period of a few weeks, plus more than 10K news articles from Guardian and NYT.\r\n\r\nUsing Vector space model as the search model in Apache Solr, we created a robust, scalable, and reliable search system which along with displaying the tweets in native format ( as seen on actual twitter.com ), also gives the users the faceted search option on the left, and various interesting analytics of the query results such as trending hashtags, sentiment analysis, data source etc. among others, which are presented using attractive graphs.\r\n\r\nMajor features are \r\n\r\n* Twitter look-and-feel for data displayed\r\n* Faceting options\r\n* Sentiment analysis\r\n* Trending hashtags\r\n\r\nand many more.\r\n\r\nWe created the project for 5 languages, namely, English, French, German, Russian and Arabic on the topic of \"Refugee crisis in Europe\". The data indexed gives a broader perspective to this topic by generating the summaries on the topics searched from Wikipedia, and fetching relevant news articles from Guardian and NY Times\r\n\r\n### Architecture of the system\r\n\r\nThe front end of the system is handled using Angular.js and backend using Java Servlets, with Apache Solr as the database.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nCollaborators :\r\n\r\n1.
